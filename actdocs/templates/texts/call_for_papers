<p>
We invite you to contribute to The Perl Conference, which will take
place in August 2017 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  These meetings were
formerly known as YAPC::EU, the yearly meeting of Perl Mongers in Europe.
</p>

<h2>The theme</h2>
<p>
The theme of this conference is <b>High-end Perl</b>: Perl is (often
in a somewhat hidden way) used for many large commercial and research applications.
So, a considerable number of talks will focus their content in this area.
</p><p>
But please, do not feel restricted to this topic: we welcome <em>any</em>
good story about your experiences with our magnificent languages!
</p>

<h2>Slots</h2>
<p>
Presentations can take 5 minutes (lightning talks), 20 or 45
minutes (normal lengths), and longer.
</p><p>
The preferred format is a 20 minute talk. It is projected that the
majority of talks will be of this length: we prefer concise
contributions by as many conferences participants as possible. We would like 45
minute talks to adhere more strictly to their subject and published audience
level.
</p><p>
Long talks (60 up to 90 minutes) are reserved for experienced
speakers covering major topics. If you have an in-depth topic you would like 
to present in some detail, perhaps with considerable discussion, a
long slot may be available for you.  This is usually split into an
introductory and an advanced session.
</p><p>
Tutorials (up to 180 minutes) are available for beginner and
introductory style presentations.
</p>

<h2>Suggestions for subjects</h2>
